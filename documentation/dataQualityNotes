## Initial Exploration - 10/12/2025

### Major Issues

**Files Excluded from Analysis:**
- **Pricing March 2023 & May 2022:** Duplicate data despite different date labels. Same SKUs, same prices, same row counts. Excluded as unreliable and not needed for sales trend analysis.
- **Cloud Warehouse Comparison Chart:** Contract document, not transactional data
- **Expense IIGF:** Operational expense report, not sales data

**International Sales Data Corruption:**
- Original file contained improperly merged data segments
- Rows 18,637-19,676 contained non-transactional data (SKU lists, inventory snapshots)
- Manually cleaned to extract two valid sales segments and standardize structure
- Final structure focuses on common fields across segments

### Basic Data Cleaning in Excel

#### International Sales ('internationalSales')
- Original file contained improperly merged data segments
- Rows 18,637-19,676 contained non-transactional data (SKU lists, inventory snapshots)
- Manually cleaned to extract two valid sales segments and standardize structure
- Final structure focuses on common fields across segments

- Found an instance of duplicated customer names where one version was fully capitalized and the other version was normal
- All records of normalized capitalization had missing SKU values
- Removed these rows from the table given that a composite key field is missing

#### Product Master ('productMaster')
- Noted that index values continued 36 rows after all other fields
- Deleted these rows to make the table continuous

- Oriignal file contained rows where SKU value was "#REF!"
- Deleted these rows

## Primary Key Validation - 10/15/2025

### SQL Analysis Results

**amazonSales:**
- Total rows: 128,975
- Missing Order ID: 0
- Missing SKU: 0
- **Rows to remove:**  0
- **Rationale:** Composite primary key (Order_ID, SKU) requires both fields

**internationalSales:**
- Total rows: 36,361
- Missing Date: 0
- Missing Customer: 0
- Missing SKU: 1404
- Non-product SKU values: 516 ("TAGS", "SHIPPING", etc)
- **Rows to remove:** 1404 
- **Rationale:** Composite primary key (Date, Customer, SKU) requires all three fields

**productMaster:**
- Total rows: 9,220
- Missing SKU Code: 47
- **Rows to remove:** 47
- **Rationale:** SKU Code is primary key; products cannot be identified without it
