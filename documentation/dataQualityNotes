### Major Issues

**Files Excluded from Analysis:**
- **Pricing March 2023 & May 2022:** Duplicate data despite different date labels. Same SKUs, same prices, same row counts. Excluded as unreliable and not needed for sales trend analysis.
- **Cloud Warehouse Comparison Chart:** Contract document, not transactional data
- **Expense IIGF:** Operational expense report, not sales data

**International Sales Data Corruption:**
- Original file contained improperly merged data segments
- Rows 18,637-19,676 contained non-transactional data (SKU lists, inventory snapshots)
- Manually cleaned to extract two valid sales segments and standardize structure
- Final structure focuses on common fields across segments

### Basic Data Cleaning in Excel

**amazonSales:**
- Total rows: 128,975
- Issues: Nothing significant to be removed at this stage.
- Rows to remove: 0
- **Final row count:** 128,975

**internationalSales:**
- Total rows: 37,432
- Issues:
  - Original file contained improperly merged data segments. Rows 18,636-19,677 contained non-transactional data (SKU lists, inventory snapshots). 1041 rows affected.
  - Found an instance of duplicated customer names where one version was fully capitalized and the other version was normal. All records of normalized capitalization had missing SKU values. 30 rows affected.
- **Rows to remove:** 1071
- **Rationale:** SKU is a necessary field
- **Final row count:** 36,361

**productMaster:**
- Total rows: 9,271
- Issues:
  - #REF value instead of SKU code. 15 rows affected.
  - Rows are blank except for the index column at the end of the table, which artificially increases number of rows. 36 rows affected.
- **Rows to remove:** 51
- **Rationale:** SKU Code is primary key; products cannot be identified without it
- **Final row count:** 9,220

## Primary Key Validation - 10/15/2025

### SQL Analysis Results

**amazonSales:**
- Total rows: 128,975
- Missing Order ID: 0
- Missing SKU: 0
- **Rows to remove:**  0
- **Rationale:** Composite primary key (Order_ID, SKU) requires both fields
- Final row count: 128,975
- **Date range:** 3/31/2022 - 6/29/2022

**internationalSales:**
- Total rows: 36,361
- Missing Date: 0
- Missing Customer: 0
- Missing SKU: 1404
- Non-product SKU values: 516 ("TAGS", "SHIPPING", etc)
- **Rows to remove:** 1920
- **Rationale:** Composite primary key (Date, Customer, SKU) requires all three fields
- Final row count: 34,441
- **Date range:** 6/5/2021 - 3/31/2022

**productMaster:**
- Total rows: 9,220
- Missing SKU Code: 47
- **Rows to remove:** 47
- **Rationale:** SKU Code is primary key; products cannot be identified without it
- Final row count: 9,173

## Final Clean Dataset Summary - 10/15/2025

3. **productMaster_clean:** 9,173 rows

**Total transaction records:** ~163,000

- Non-transactional files: 4 files excluded
- Corrupted segments: ~1,000 rows from internationalSales

#Addressing Dataset Issues
### Initial Assessment
The dataset appeared to contain 13 months of continuous sales data across two channels, suitable for trend analysis and forecasting.

### Critical Findings During Cleaning
1. **Temporal Gap:** April-May 2022 International sales data was corrupted (missing SKU values in significant portions), requiring removal
2. **Channel Overlap:** Only 1 day of overlap between channels (March 31, 2022), insufficient for comparative time-series analysis
3. **Different Schema Strengths:** 
   - Amazon data includes detailed geographic information
   - International data includes customer identifiers
   - Neither channel has both

### The Decision Point
Rather than:
- Proceed with a flawed forecast based on insufficient temporal overlap
- Force comparisons between incomparable time periods
- Ignore 163,000 valid transactions

I chose to:
- Treat the channels as separate analytical opportunities
- Leverage each dataset's unique attributes
- Focus on insights that don't require temporal continuity
