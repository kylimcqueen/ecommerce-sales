amazonSales,Unnamed: 22,Unnamed column with  data being either blanks or 'False'.  Will not make changes to preserve data reproducibility.,128974,1,No,
amazonSales,fulfilled-by,Blanks. Not very relevant given that we're not focusing heavily on shipping.,89698,0.695473506,No,
amazonSales,Qty,"Some rows have Qty=0, which implies that they shouldn't be included on a sales sheet at all. Many of them have Status=Cancelled, but not all. Cannot change without more information.",12807,0.099299084,No,
amazonSales,Currency,Blanks.,7795,0.060438538,No,
amazonSales,Courier,"Blanks, unsure of ship status. Think more information can be gained from Status column. Also not very relevant to current analysis.",6872,0.053282057,No,
amazonSales,Amount,"Amount=0 implies that item was free. I know I saw a lot of 'Free' text in one money-related column in productMaster, so will check it out again when I get there. Will not address - low priority.",2343,0.018166452,No,
amazonSales,ship-state,"Blanks/nulls. Note that all blanks in this column correspond with ship-city, ship-postal-code, and ship-country. So if there is no ship-city, there is no location information at all. Will remove all of these in SQL.",33,0.000255866,No,
amazonSales,ship-country,Same as above.,33,0.000255866,No,
amazonSales,ship-city,Ahemdabad seems to be a mispelling of Ahmedabad,6,4.6521E-05,Yes,Changed instances of Ahemdabad to Ahmedabad.
amazonSales,ship-city,Amravati. seems to be a mispelling of AMRAVATI (period included at the end when it shouldn't be). So few records are affected and this is not relevant to current analysis. Will leave alone.,1,7.7535E-06,Yes,
amazonSales,ship-city,ANANTPUR seems to be a misspelling of ANANTAPUR. ,1,7.7535E-06,Yes,

amazonSales,ship-city,Multiple cities have capitalization discrepancies where there are two separate entries for the same city where one has normal capitalization (ex: Mumbai) and one has all caps (ex: MUMBAI). Will change all cities to all caps in SQL to address this.,Unsure,,Yes,Addressed in SQL.
amazonSales,ship-state,Too many states. Google states there are 28 states and 8 territories in India.,Unsue,,Yes,Addressed in SQL.
internationalSales,Multiple,"Due to some type of formatting issue when creating the dataset, there are four distinct segments of data. Segment 1 is made up of rows 2 - 18,636, which  contain normal, appropriately formatted data that corresponds to the data headers in row 1. Segment 2 is rows 18,637 - 18,661 which contain only SKU data. Segment 3 is rows 18,662 - 19,676 which contains only Style and Stock data. Segment 4 is rows 19,677 to the end, which has ALMOST the same values as Segment 1, but displayed in a different order (example: in Segment 1, DATE is in column 2 while in Segment 4, DATE is in column 3). However, Segment 1 has Size as a column, which does not exist as a column in Segment 4. Similarly, Segment 4 has Stock as a column, which does not exist in Segment 1.  I will drop the Size and Stock columns, which aren't cnsistent throughout the whole dataset. I'll drop all the incomplete data from Segments 2 and 3. Then I'll merge Segments 1 and 4 so that the data for each column is only represented in that column throughout the entire table. I will do another look through this sheet for issues after the major re-formatting.",18794,0.502097192,Yes,"Deleted segments 2 and 3, which had unusable data. Changed the order of columns in segment 4 to mach segment 1. "
internationalSales,Month,Remaining issues were found after major re-formatting of this table. The entire column seems unnecessary. Odd formatting for most values and there's already a Date column,37431,1,No,
internationalSales,CUSTOMER,"Two identical customer names where one name is ""Mrs Sumitha Raju"" (30 records, all missing SKU) and the other name is ""MRS. SUMITHA RAJU"" (445 records, no blank SKUs). Will remove records with ""Mrs Sumitha Raju"" given that they all have missing SKU, which is necessary for creating a composite key.",475,0.012690016,No,"Deleted all records with ""Mrs Sumitha Raju"" as CUSTOMER."
internationalSales,Style,There a small number of cells that have date values instead of Style values. Most of them also have no SKU. These will be ignored in the analysis.,14,0.000374022,No,
internationalSales,SKU,"Nonsensical words in the SKU column. Found when I sorted descending. Mainly ""TAGS"", ""TAGS(LABOUR)"", ""TAG PRINTING"", ""SHIPPING CHARGES"", and ""SHIPPING"". These must be deleted given that this field will be part of a composite key.",516,0.013785365,Yes,Removed in SQL
internationalSales,SKU,When I run COUNTBLANK function it says there are 2473 blanks. These must be deleted given that this field will be part of a composite key.,2473,0.066068232,Yes,Removed in SQL

productMaster,Stock,Blanks but I think these will all be taken care of by deleting the blanks in the index column,36,9.713883474,Yes,Adressed by deleting rows corresponding to  extra index values.
productMaster,Category,"Blanks. Mostly the same issue as above, but there are also a handful that have the rest of the rows filled out. The common denominator for those values is they all have Stock=0. Not going to delete because they still might exist in one of the sales records.",45,1.386939571,No,
productMaster,Size,"Blanks due to the index, as above. Not going to include Blanks as an issue for any further columns if the issue is directly related to the index.",36,0.844162876,Yes,Adressed by deleting rows corresponding to  extra index values.
productMaster,Size,"FREE is not a size. Not sure what to do about that, but doubt it will affect analysis much. Notice there are a significant amount of SKU values asssociated with these items that have #REF or blank as SKU value",223,0.744206194,No,
productMaster,SKU Code,1,15,0.253736192,Yes,"Deleted all rows with ""#REF!"" for value in SKU Code column."

pricingMarch2021,MRP Old,Notice that if MRP Old has a Nill than almost all the other MRPs have Nills. Will kep for now. This is likely reflected across all the other MRPs since they're so homogenous.,37,0.027840482,NA,
pricingMarch2021,Myntra MRP,"Noting that there are only 31 Nills here, where there are 37 for all the others",31,0.023325809,NA,
pricingMarch2021,TP ,"Same value issue seen in pricingMarch2021, will keep.",6,0.004514673,NA,
pricingMay2022,MRP Old,"Even though the columns are a little different between pricingMarch2021 and pricingMay2022, the Nill distribution looks exactly the same (37 rows with Nills in most of the MRP columns). These two sheets also have the same number of rows. I compared the SKUs, TP, and Amazon MRP between the two charts and they were exactly the same. Based on this information, I've determined that these two charts are unusable. They both provide duplicate information for supposedly differnt time periods, so I have no way to know what time period they actually represent. Additionally, the information is not directly relevant to a sales trend analysis.",,0,NA,
